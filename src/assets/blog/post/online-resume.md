### Separate Yourself From The Competition With An Online Resume

Consider putting your resume online. It's a great place to showcase your talent through content, photos, multimedia and interactivity.

Including a video is a great way to reflect your personality and make a personal appeal. Just upload it to YouTube or Vimeo and embed it on your site.

If appropriate include a page with some portfolio samples. Lastly make sure to include relevant links to your social media profiles such as LinkedIn.

Online resumes are great for job seekers and also for individuals seeking new clients and business.
