### Some Helpful Tips for Playing Flash Animations in PowerPoint

1.  [Check out this article](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/play-an-adobe-macromedia-flash-animation-in-a-presentation-3b681b8e-6ca9-413f-b41a-eb748babc588) for help with embedding Flash animations in PowerPoint.
2.  Use a PC (not a Mac) computer. Embedded Flash animations will not work on a Mac.
3.  Use the keyboard to transition from one slide to the next (i.e., press the space bar or forward arrow key). Do not use the mouse as it can possibly cause problems with the animation.
4.  If you do accidentally click the mouse to transition the slide, move the mouse outside the Flash animation and then click it again. If the animation fills the entire screen you'll need to click on the black area outside the slide either above or below the animation.
5.  If PowerPoint ever asks you to "Enable Macros" please do it. For security purposes make sure of course that the PowerPoint comes to you from a trusted source.
6.  Make sure that Adobe Flash Player is installed on the PC you are using for the presentation ([http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/)).
7.  If there is any delay when you try to transition from a slide with a Flash animation, do not try again but rather be patient. Depending upon the animation it may take a second or two to transition. Again, please remember to use the keyboard to transition between slides.
8.  Before showing the presentation make sure you test it on the PC you are going to use.
