        <h3>Top Things To Include On Your Website</h3>
        <!-- 2011-05-24 22:33:48 -->
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>A good content management system</strong>. There are some
            great commercial ones but also excellent non-commercial, free of
            charge CMS's. WordPress, Joomla and Drupal are good options to
            consider. A good CMS will allow those who are not web
            designers/developers to update website content. And it will make the
            website more extensible since there are thousands of available
            extensions and plug-ins such as forms, slideshows, dropdowns, RSS
            feed integration, social web integration, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fresh content</strong>. You should update your site
            regularly with some fresh content so that the website remains
            relevant and doesn't become stale. It can also give a user a reason
            to come back.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A blog</strong> but you need to be sure you can maintain it.
            A blog needs to be fresh to keep your audience. You can use a blog
            for SEO by including relevant keywords and links and it's a source
            of fresh content as well. It can also help promote you or your
            company as an expert in the topics you blog about â€“ it gives you the
            opportunity to share your expertise. Additionally, you can offer
            your blog as an RSS feed others can subscribe to.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content that is copywritten for the web</strong>. Content
            should be written with the web user in mind and not just copied and
            pasted from collateral. Doing it this way will improve your chances
            the user will read the content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Easy to follow intuitive layout and navigation</strong>.
            Users shouldn't have to hunt to find what they are looking for. Site
            search functionality should also help if there is a lot of website
            content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visually appealing branded design</strong>. This will help
            users to feel confident in your company, product and service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social media integration</strong>. If you have a Facebook
            page, YouTube Channel and/or Twitter page, there are ways you can
            integrate these into your website. It's a nice way to include a
            variety of fresh content and there are ways to integrate it so they
            don't need to leave your website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>An organic SEO campaign</strong> to help drive traffic to
            your web pages. Also consider pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns as a way
            to supplement this effort. People click the organic results more
            often but good organic results requires more effort to achieve. We
            recommend an organic SEO campaign for your most important keywords
            and then a PPC campaign to cover all possible keywords.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Analytics (or another good analytics program)</strong
            >. Google Analytics is free. It provides granular website
            statistical information that can help you gauge the success of your
            website efforts. This data can also help you make better decisions
            as to what kinds of adjustments and updates you need to make to the
            website to increase traffic and conversions.
          </li>

        <h3>Separate Yourself From The Competition With An Online Resume</h3>
        <!-- 2011-10-21 15:20:29 -->
        <p>
          Consider putting your resume online. It's a great place to showcase
          your talent through content, photos, multimedia and interactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Including a video is a great way to reflect your personality and make
          a personal appeal. Just upload it to YouTube or Vimeo and embed it on
          your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          If appropriate include a page with some portfolio samples. Lastly make
          sure to include relevant links to your social media profiles such as
          LinkedIn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Online resumes are great for job seekers and also for individuals
          seeking new clients and business.

        <h3>Some Helpful Tips for Playing Flash Animations in PowerPoint</h3>
        <!-- 2012-12-10 21:56:21-->
        <ol>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/play-an-adobe-macromedia-flash-animation-in-a-presentation-3b681b8e-6ca9-413f-b41a-eb748babc588"
              target="_blank"
              >Check out this article</a
            >
            for help with embedding Flash animations in PowerPoint.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a PC (not a Mac) computer. Embedded Flash animations will not
            work on a Mac.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the keyboard to transition from one slide to the next (i.e.,
            press the space bar or forward arrow key). Do not use the mouse as
            it can possibly cause problems with the animation.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you do accidentally click the mouse to transition the slide, move
            the mouse outside the Flash animation and then click it again. If
            the animation fills the entire screen you'll need to click on the
            black area outside the slide either above or below the animation.
          </li>
          <li>
            If PowerPoint ever asks you to "Enable Macros" please do it. For
            security purposes make sure of course that the PowerPoint comes to
            you from a trusted source.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that Adobe Flash Player is installed on the PC you are
            using for the presentation (<a
              href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/"
              target="_blank"
              >http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</a
            >).
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is any delay when you try to transition from a slide with a
            Flash animation, do not try again but rather be patient. Depending
            upon the animation it may take a second or two to transition. Again,
            please remember to use the keyboard to transition between slides.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before showing the presentation make sure you test it on the PC you
            are going to use.
          </li>
